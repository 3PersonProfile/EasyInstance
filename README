--So, to use EasyInstance you need to first get the module from "https://create.roblox.com/store/asset/18468448781/EasyInstance".
--And ill give you an example line you can use with it. (can put anywhere, i just choose to put in serverscript service.)
local EI = require(game.ServerScriptService:FindFirstChild("EasyInstance"))
EI.create("Part", --What to create
	"Red flip/flop", --What color
	workspace, --Where it is created
	0, --Its Transparency
	0,5,0, --Its Position (In vector3)
	true --If it should be anchored
)
--Please note, if it cannot have a certain property it will return that as nil.
i.e: A boolvalue with 1 transparency would be nil.
